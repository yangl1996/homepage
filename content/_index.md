## About me

I am a cofounder and the CTO of [MegaLabs](https://megaeth.systems), a start-up that is building MegaETH, the
first Real-Time Blockchain. I recently finished my PhD in Computer Science at
MIT, advised by [Mohammad Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/). I
was part of the [Networks and Mobile Systems Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu)
(<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#FF0000">N</font><font
color="#009900">M</font><font color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) of MIT
CSAIL.  My thesis is on efficient consensus and synchronization for distributed
systems. I received my SM from MIT in 2020 and my BS in Computer Science from
Peking University in 2018.

I love designing and building systems that are robust, performant, and easy to
use. My current research focuses on computer network problems in the setting of
blockchains. Some examples are 
[DispersedLedger](https://github.com/yangl1996/dispersed-ledger), a framework
for building BFT state machine replication protocols that run fast on 
fluctuating networks; [Rateless
IBLTs](https://github.com/yangl1996/riblt), a family of universal and near-optimal rateless
codes for reconciling set differences. I have also published on the security
aspect of blockchain protocols. My work has been supported by generous gifts from
the Ethereum Foundation.

Occasionally, I write about what I do in [my blog](https://blog.leiy.me). When
away from the keyboard, I enjoy hiking, cycling, sailing and travelling. Plus,
I am a licensed amateur radio operator.  My callsign is KC1NOR.
