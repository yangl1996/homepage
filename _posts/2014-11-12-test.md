### Abstract
Monte Carlo simulation for radiotherapy sources is a computationally intensive operation, especially for large geometries; for this reason it is rarely used for the planning or verification of extended source to surface distance (ESSD) treatments such as total body irradiation (TBI).
The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital has proposed a modification to its current TBI treatment protocol which will allow for computer based treatment planning from CT data sets instead of manual calculation.
The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the dose delivered to a volume at ESSD by comparing simulated results with experimental data.

A simple rectilinear phantom geometry was defined that facilitated a simple simulation configuration as well as practical experimental data collection.
Experimental data was collected using a Solid Water/Plastic Water/PMMA phantom positioned at a number of ESSD's between 190 and 400 cm, and irradiated using a clinical linear accelerator operating at 10 MeV.
These same experiments were then modelled using the EGSnrc radiation transport Monte Carlo software with BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc user codes.
All ESSD measurements were normalised to well defined isocentric reference conditions.
Precise Monte Carlo models were generated by examining the performance of a number of variance reduction techniques for ESSD geometries.
Energy spectra were calculated using Monte Carlo models to investigate the effect of backscatter on the delivered dose to the volume at ESSD, as well as examine the effect of a PMMA build-up screen on the system.

It was found that Monte Carlo simulation for ESSD geometries is capable of predicting the dose to a volume to within 5% of that indicated by experimental data, when the experiment is performed under conditions that are easily simplified, suitable for simulation.
Photon splitting demonstrated the greatest ability to reduce model variance (increase model precision) while keeping computational overhead to a minimum.
In normalising all ESSD data to isocentric reference conditions, systematic errors in the Monte Carlo simulations were more easily identified.
Monte Carlo generated energy spectra also showed that a PMMA build-up screen introduced 35\% more electrons into the system, thus increasing the superficial dose to the volume.
